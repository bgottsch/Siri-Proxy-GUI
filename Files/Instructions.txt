FAQ

This WILL NOT install Siri on a non approved Apple iDevide, microwave, etc.
This is only a GUI for SiriProxy. It DOES NOT install the server. Maybe on future updates...
This program uses AppleScript for most of the code and a plist file in "~/Library/Application Support/Siri Proxy/". A possible solution for missing data or values is to delete the plist file. The program will create a new one.
